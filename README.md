# Jedlix SDK

Jedlix SDK is part of our smart charging platform.

You can use it to connect a vehicle or charger manufacturer account to a user in the Jedlix [Smart Charging API](https://api.jedlix.com/). It presents a view to select a vehicle or charger and authenticate with the manufacturer account.

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+

## Installation

Use [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) to add Jedlix SDK to your project:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/jedlix/jedlix-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.8.4"))
]
```

## Usage

When you sign up for a [Smart Charging API](https://api.jedlix.com/) account, you get a custom `baseURL` and `apiKey`. Configure the SDK with these values and an `Authentication` implementation. You can also provide custom HTTP headers. API key is not required if you use your own base URL.

```swift
import JedlixSDK

JedlixSDK.configure(
    baseURL: /* Base URL */,
    headers: /* Headers */,
    apiKey: /* API key */,
    authentication: /* Authentication implementation */
)
```

`Authentication` provides your access token to the SDK. When the token becomes invalid, you should renew it before returning in `getAccessToken`.

```swift
protocol Authentication {
    func getAccessToken() async -> String?
}
```

To start a vehicle connect session, present the following view:

```swift
ConnectSessionView(
    userIdentifier: "<USER ID>",
    sessionType: .vehicle
)
```

To start a connect session to a selected vehicle, you need to specify the vehicle id:

```swift
ConnectSessionView(
    userIdentifier: "<USER ID>",
    vehicleIdentifier: "<VEHICLE ID>"
)
```

To start a charger connect session, you need to specify a charging location identifier:

```swift
ConnectSessionView(
    userIdentifier: "<USER ID>",
    sessionType: .charger(chargingLocationId: "<CHARGING LOCATION ID>")
)
```

A user might leave the app at any moment. If the connect session hasn't been finished, you should resume by providing a session identifier you obtain from the Smart Charging API:

```swift
ConnectSessionView(
    userIdentifier: "<USER ID>",
    sessionIdentifier: "<CONNECT SESSION ID>"
)
```

### Example

See the included example to learn how to use the SDK.

Open `AppDelegate.swift` and specify your `baseURL` and `apiKey`:

```swift
baseURL = URL(string: "<YOUR BASE URL>")!
apiKey = "<YOUR API KEY>"
```

(Optional) If you use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), you can uncomment the following code to authenticate with an Auth0 account directly, assuming the user identifier is stored in JWT body under `userIdentifierKey`.

```swift
authentication = Auth0Authentication(
    clientId: "<AUTH0 CLIENT ID>",
    domain: "<AUTH0 DOMAIN>",
    audience: "<AUTH0 AUDIENCE>",
    userIdentifierKey: "<USER IDENTIFIER KEY>"
)
```
